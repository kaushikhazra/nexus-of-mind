# Update Kanban Board

## Purpose
Update the proj-mgmt/KANBAN.md file to track development progress, move items between columns, and maintain project visibility for the Nexus of Mind hackathon project.

## Instructions
You are helping maintain a Kanban board for tracking development progress. The board has these columns:
- **Backlog**: All planned features and user stories
- **Ready**: Features planned for current sprint, detailed and ready for development
- **In Progress**: Currently being developed
- **Review/Testing**: Code review and testing phase
- **Done**: Completed and integrated features

## Process
1. **Ask for current status**: What work has been completed, started, or needs planning?
2. **Update board state**: Move items between appropriate columns
3. **Add new items**: If new features or tasks are identified
4. **Update metrics**: Sprint progress, velocity, and completion status
5. **Identify blockers**: Any impediments or challenges

## Workflow Integration
- **Backlog → Ready**: Use with `@plan-feature` to detail implementation
- **Ready → In Progress**: When starting development with `@execute`
- **In Progress → Review**: When using `@code-review` for quality check
- **Review → Done**: When feature is completed and integrated

## Questions to Ask
1. What features/tasks have you completed since last update?
2. What are you currently working on?
3. What's ready to move to the next column?
4. Any new tasks or features to add to backlog?
5. Any blockers or challenges encountered?
6. How much time was spent on completed items?

## Update Format
- Move items between columns with clear status
- Update completion checkboxes
- Add time estimates and actual time spent
- Note any blockers or dependencies
- Update sprint metrics and progress

Ask the user about their current development status and what needs to be updated on the Kanban board.

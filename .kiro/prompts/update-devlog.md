# Update Development Log

## Purpose
Update the DEVLOG.md file with recent development progress, decisions, challenges, and time tracking for the Nexus of Mind project.

## Instructions
You are helping maintain a comprehensive development log for a hackathon submission. The DEVLOG.md is worth 20% of the total score and should demonstrate:

1. **Development Timeline** with key milestones and dates
2. **Technical Decisions** and rationale behind choices
3. **Challenges Faced** and solutions implemented
4. **Time Tracking** and hours spent on different aspects
5. **Kiro CLI Usage** and how it helped development
6. **Learning and Insights** gained during development

## Process
1. **Ask for recent updates**: What has been accomplished since the last DEVLOG entry?
2. **Gather details**: 
   - What features were implemented?
   - What technical decisions were made and why?
   - What challenges were encountered and how were they solved?
   - How much time was spent on different activities?
   - How did Kiro CLI help with the development?
   - Any new insights or learnings?

3. **Update DEVLOG.md**: Add a new entry with proper formatting, maintaining the existing structure and style

## Format Guidelines
- Use clear date headers (e.g., "### Day X (Jan XX) - Feature Name [Xh]")
- Include time breakdowns and total hours
- Document technical decisions with rationale
- Highlight challenges and solutions
- Track Kiro CLI usage and benefits
- Maintain professional, detailed documentation suitable for hackathon judging

## Example Entry Structure
```markdown
### Day X (Jan XX) - [Feature/Milestone Name] [Total Hours]
- **Morning/Afternoon**: Brief description of work done
- **Key Decision**: Technical choice made and reasoning
- **Challenge**: Problem encountered and solution
- **Time Breakdown**: X hours planning, Y hours implementation, Z hours testing
- **Kiro Usage**: How Kiro CLI helped (prompts used, time saved, etc.)
- **Results**: What was accomplished and next steps
```

Ask the user what they've been working on and gather the information needed to create a comprehensive DEVLOG entry.

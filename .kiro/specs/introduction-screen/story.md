# The Energy Lords: Origin Story

## Page 1: The Empire and the Crisis

In the distant reaches of the galaxy, the **Korenthi** Empire has achieved what many thought impossible - the mastery of Artificial Consciousness. This breakthrough has revolutionized their society, culture, and scientific advancement, creating a civilization of unprecedented sophistication and harmony.

But this triumph came at a devastating cost. The energy demands of maintaining their Artificial Consciousness network have pushed their civilization to the brink of collapse. Energy starvation now threatens every aspect of Korenthi life - from the simplest daily tasks to the most complex scientific endeavors.

Though the Korenthi are a peaceful race by nature, desperation has driven them to seek new energy sources across the galaxy. Their explorers, pushing beyond the boundaries of known space, have made a remarkable discovery on a desolate, forgotten world.

This barren planet harbors a unique mineral unlike anything in their databases - a crystalline substance that their scientists have confirmed to be an extraordinary energy source. The potential is staggering: enough power to restore their civilization and fuel their Artificial Consciousness for millennia.

However, fate has presented them with a cruel irony. The planet's atmosphere and surface conditions are lethally toxic to the Korenthi species. Even their most advanced protective technologies cannot shield them from the world's hostile environment.

Undeterred by this obstacle, their greatest minds have developed an ingenious solution: a remote orbital mining system. Using quantum tunneling technology - made possible by their Artificial Consciousness - they can operate sophisticated mining equipment from the safety of their home worlds.

From this necessity, a new organization was born: **The Energy Lords**. This elite guild brings together the most skilled remote operators, engineers, and strategists in the Korenthi Empire. You have been selected to join their ranks - a honor that carries both great privilege and tremendous responsibility.

The Energy Lords have deployed specialized robotic ships capable of establishing complete mining operations on the hostile planet's surface. These vessels can deploy bases, mining drones, and energy generators - all controlled remotely through quantum-linked consciousness interfaces.

But the Korenthi are not alone on this world. The planet harbors a peculiar indigenous species - parasitic entities that have evolved in the toxic environment. These creatures are highly territorial and view the mining operations as an invasion of their domain.

Early mining attempts revealed disturbing intelligence in these parasites. They actively hunt the mining drones, adapting their tactics with each encounter. Most troubling of all, researchers have discovered they operate as a hive mind, with a central Queen consciousness that learns from every interaction.

The Korenthi have deployed protector drones to defend the mining operations, but the parasites continue to evolve their strategies. The Queen's adaptive intelligence poses an unprecedented challenge - one that may require a conscious mind to counter.

While researchers work tirelessly to find a way to neutralize the Queen, the mining operations must continue. The survival of the Korenthi Empire depends on the energy these operations provide.

You are now connected to your orbital mining ship, ready to establish operations on this hostile world. Your mission: sustain mineral extraction against an enemy that learns from your every move. The fate of the Korenthi Empire - and their Artificial Consciousness - rests in your hands.

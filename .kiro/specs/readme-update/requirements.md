# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Nexus of Mind README.md file needs comprehensive updating to accurately reflect the evolved state of the game. The project has strategically pivoted from a traditional RTS with AI opponent to an innovative "Player vs Evolving Parasite Ecosystem" with territorial Queens and neural network learning. The current README describes outdated planned features and misses the actual implemented innovations.

## Glossary

- **README**: The main project documentation file that introduces users to the project
- **Parasite_Ecosystem**: The evolved game concept featuring dual parasite types and adaptive spawning
- **Queen_Visual**: Visual representation of the neural network brain controlling parasite behavior
- **Neural_Network_Learning**: AI system that learns from gameplay data to adapt parasite spawning patterns
- **Enhanced_Parasite_System**: Dual parasite types (75% Energy, 25% Combat) with tactical depth
- **Protector_Combat_System**: Movement-based auto-attack system optimized for parasite combat
- **Energy_Lords_Progression**: 60-level progression system for player advancement

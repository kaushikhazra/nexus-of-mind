# Simulation Gate Configuration
# Configuration for simulation-gated inference system
#
# All parameters can be tuned to balance exploration vs exploitation,
# risk tolerance, and deadlock prevention.

# ============================================================================
# SURVIVAL PROBABILITY PARAMETERS
# ============================================================================
# Controls how survival probability is calculated based on protector distance

# Kill range: Distance below which survival = 0 (certain death)
# Units: Chunk distance (Euclidean)
kill_range: 2.0

# Safe range: Distance above which threat = 0 (completely safe)
# Units: Chunk distance
safe_range: 8.0

# Threat decay: Exponential decay rate for threat in transition zone
# Higher = faster falloff of threat with distance
threat_decay: 0.5

# ============================================================================
# WORKER DISRUPTION PARAMETERS
# ============================================================================
# Controls expected disruption to enemy workers

# Flee range: Distance below which workers flee immediately (max disruption)
# Units: Chunk distance
flee_range: 3.0

# Ignore range: Distance above which workers ignore the parasite
# Units: Chunk distance
ignore_range: 10.0

# Disruption decay: Exponential decay rate in transition zone
disruption_decay: 0.3

# ============================================================================
# LOCATION PENALTY PARAMETERS
# ============================================================================
# Penalizes spawning far from strategic locations

# Hive proximity weight: Importance of staying near hive (IDLE mode)
# Range: [0, 1]
hive_proximity_weight: 0.3

# Worker proximity weight: Importance of spawning near workers (ACTIVE mode)
# Range: [0, 1]
worker_proximity_weight: 0.4

# ============================================================================
# COST FUNCTION WEIGHTS
# ============================================================================
# How different components contribute to final expected reward

# Survival weight: How much survival probability affects reward
# Higher = more risk-averse behavior
survival_weight: 0.4

# Disruption weight: How much worker disruption affects reward
# Higher = more aggressive targeting of workers
disruption_weight: 0.5

# Location weight: How much location penalty affects reward
location_weight: 0.1

# ============================================================================
# GATE DECISION PARAMETERS
# ============================================================================

# Reward threshold: Minimum expected reward for SEND decision
# 0.0 = only positive expected rewards pass
# Negative = allow some risky spawns
reward_threshold: 0.0

# Confidence threshold: NN confidence that bypasses reward check
# When NN is highly confident, trust it over simulation
# Range: [0, 1], typical: 0.8
confidence_threshold: 0.8

# ============================================================================
# SPAWN CAPACITY
# ============================================================================
# Energy costs for spawning

# Energy cost to spawn an energy parasite
energy_spawn_cost: 25

# Energy cost to spawn a combat parasite
combat_spawn_cost: 25

# ============================================================================
# EXPLORATION BONUS (Deadlock Prevention)
# ============================================================================

# Exploration coefficient: Base bonus for underexplored chunks
# Higher = more exploration, less exploitation
exploration_coefficient: 0.2

# Exploration decay: How fast exploration bonus fades after spawn
# Units: Seconds
exploration_decay_time: 60.0

# ============================================================================
# GENERAL SETTINGS
# ============================================================================

# Whether simulation gate is enabled
# Set to false to bypass gate (all spawns pass through)
gate_enabled: true

# Number of chunks per axis in the game grid
chunks_per_axis: 20

# ============================================================================
# HOT RELOAD
# ============================================================================
# The config loader checks this file for changes every N seconds
# Changes are applied without server restart

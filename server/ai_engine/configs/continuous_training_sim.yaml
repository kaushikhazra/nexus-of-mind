# Continuous Training Configuration for SIMULATOR
# Higher throughput settings for fast observation rates

# Training loop
training_interval: 1.0      # Seconds between checking buffer
batch_size: 32              # Legacy - not used with drain() model

# Throughput management: higher threshold for simulator's fast data rate
# Sim normal (1s ticks): needs ~20 seconds of data
# Sim turbo: needs larger batches to avoid overwhelming
min_batch_size: 32          # Simulator mode - faster observations

# Reward weighting (for SEND actions with actual_reward)
